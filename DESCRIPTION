Description: This package implements the ABCD change-point method from the corresponding paper "Adaptive Block-Based Change-Point Detection for Sparse Spatially Clustered Data with Applications in Remote Sensing Imaging" (2025).  This method focuses on detecting change-points which are spatially clustered in some Euclidean space. This works by dividing the time series up in space into blocking structures with a range of block sizes to capture change-points of different size with a much higher signal-to-noise ratio. The ABCD method is implemented here for high-dimensional data as well as image data.
